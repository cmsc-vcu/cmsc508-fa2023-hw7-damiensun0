The assignment involves creating a comprehensive database for a company, managed by a renowned sensei from Kill-Bill. The database captures information on skills, certifications, employees, and roles within the organization. Skills and certifications have unique IDs, names, descriptions, and URLs. Employees include details such as ID, name, email, LinkedIn URL, headshot, discord handle, bio, and join date. Roles consist of role ID, name, and a sort ID for report creation. The database establishes associations between skills and employees, tracking acquisition dates and anticipated completion dates. Similarly, employees are associated with roles, with the system recording assignment dates. The ultimate goal is to generate HTML reports and queries for valuable insights into employee skills, certifications, roles, and their interconnections.
